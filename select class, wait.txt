wait
======
	for some transactions, application will take time to complete the transaction.
	the script execution should wait for sometime, till the transaction is completed and continue.
		2 types of wait

	 . implicit wait
		driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(20,TimeUnit.SECONDS);
					               time, units

		 
		any where in the program, if element is not found it will consider wait.
	               if element is found within the time, it will continue.
			(so it is considered for   findElement)


	 . explicit wait
		based on the need,,, we need diff wait times for diff statements in the code
		
		Thread.sleep(millisec);
		 it will compulsory wait for the time specified and then continue to next line.


Exceptions
-------------------
	these are unexpected / possible errors raised during runtime.

	Exception  ------ parent class
	    FileNotFoundException
	    ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException
	    NullPointerException
                   InterruptedException
                   NoSuchElementException...............etc

		2 ways to handle exceptions

		.  try, catch block
		.  throws

		try, catch
		----------------
			the code which is possibility of raising exception, write in try block
		   and handle the exception in  catch block.
			after try block,,immediatly catch block should start   ( no code between try block, catch block)
			every try should have atleast one or more catch blocks.
			a try block can have one more try block,,,, every try should have its own catch block.
